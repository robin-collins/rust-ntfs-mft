# Project Title
This project provides a comprehensive tool for analyzing the NTFS Master File Table (MFT) to quickly gather a complete picture of all files on a drive. It serves as an AI-driven file manager and personal filesystem organizer, integrating with vector databases for generative AI applications.

## Purpose and Description
The NTFS MFT is a special file on NTFS volumes that contains records of all files and directories. This project leverages the MFT to enable rapid file system analysis, which is crucial for tasks such as data recovery and security assessments. Additionally, it envisions an application that uses AI to intelligently manage and organize files, integrating with vector databases to enhance search and categorization capabilities.

## Installation and Usage Instructions
Clone the project using the following command:

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```

## Logging Configuration
To control the verbosity of log outputs, set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to the desired log level before running the program. The available log levels are: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, and `trace`.
For example, to run the program with `info` level logging, use the following command:

```bash
  RUST_LOG=info npm run start
```

## Future Roadmap
- AI-driven categorization of files
- Integration with vector databases for advanced search capabilities
- We welcome contributions, especially from those with expertise in AI, machine learning, and database technologies.
